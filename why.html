        <p class="why">Environmental sustainability is important because of how much energy, food and human-made resources we use everyday.</p>
        <p class="why"><strong>Rapid population growth</strong> has resulted in increased farming and manufacturing, leading to more greenhouse gas emissions, unsustainable energy use and deforestation.</p>
        <p class="why">Achieving a balance between natural resources and human consumption that is both respectful of the natural world yet fuels our modern way of life, is one of the most important pieces in the climate-change puzzle. With unchecked resource depletion, we risk a global food crisis, energy crisis, and an increase in greenhouse gas emissions that will lead to a global warming crisis. On the other hand, with too many restrictions on the use of natural resources, we risk slowing technological and economic advancement.</p>

        <p class="why">For the future of our planet and the humans who populate it, it is vital to weigh the competing needs of environmental protection and human development so both the natural world and society are able to flourish. Striking this delicate balance is challenging—though not impossible—and issues surrounding sustainability, the environment, and society have been the focus of scientists, philosophers, politicians, and policy experts for decades.</p>
